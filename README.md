Jorge Torres -- performing several operations on a DataFrame to process contact information from an Excel file and then exporting it to a CSV file. Reads data from an Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame. Parses JSON-like strings in one column of the DataFrame, extracting contact information. Splits the 'name' column into 'first_name' and 'last_name' columns. Reorders the columns in the DataFrame. Check the datatypes one before exporting as CSV file. Exports the DataFrame to a CSV file.

Parris -- Steps Taken

Creation of Campaign DataFrame:
The DataFrame campaign_df is created as a copy of the existing DataFrame crowdfunding_info_df.
The desired columns are renamed, converted to appropriate data types, and formatted:
The "blurb" column is renamed to "description".
The "goal" column is converted to float data type.
The "pledged" column is converted to float data type.
The "launch_date" column is converted to datetime format.
The "end_date" column is converted to datetime format.
The "category_id" and "subcategory_id" columns are merged with respective unique numbers from category and subcategory DataFrames.
A new column containing the unique four-digit contact ID number from the contact.xlsx file is created. (Contributed by Parris)
Exporting DataFrame:
The cleaned DataFrame is exported to a CSV file named campaign.csv.
Reading Contact Information:
Contact information is read from the Excel file contacts.xlsx into a DataFrame named contact_info_df. The header is specified at row 3.
